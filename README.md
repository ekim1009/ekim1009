## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Esther!

I'm a full stack Software Engineer based in New York, NY. I have experience in Javascript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and React.  


### ðŸŒµ Tumbleweed
Most recently, I developed ![Tumbleweed](https://tumbleweed-cdc.github.io/), which is an open-source framework designed for fast and consistent data propogation between microservices using Change Data Capture (CDC) and the transactional outbox pattern. Tumbleweed automatically deploys a self-hosted log-based CDC pipeline that monitors changes in one or more PostgreSQL databases and sends those data changes to consumer microservices in near-real time. 

You can read about the case study ![here](https://tumbleweed-cdc.github.io/docs/introduction)!
